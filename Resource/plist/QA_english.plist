		<key>question</key>
		<string>Where should I ideally locate the router within my home?</string>
		<key>answer</key>
		<string>Wi-Fi routers operating on the 2.4 GHz band cover a range of up to 150 feet (46m) indoors. Physical obstructions in homes such as brick walls and metal frames or sidings reduce the range of a Wi-Fi network by 25% or more. For optimal performance, please follow these simple guidelines:
Position your router in a centralized location that minimizes the distance between the router &amp; your Pureit device.
Stone, tile, mirrors, and large metal surfaces tend to interfere with wireless communication. Avoid placing your router near such surfaces.
If possible, locate your router in an open space at least 3 feet above the floor.</string>
